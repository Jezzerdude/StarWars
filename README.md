# StarWars
Star Wars Project version 1

This project is my attempt at using the new Android jetpack libraries.
Development is still currently ongoing.

Application:
The purpose of the application is to tead star wars characters
Directly from a web service and display their names on screen.
When a character is selected the app will then take the user to
A details screen where more details are presented about the character.

Architecture:
The application is written with MVVM in mind so that I can use the
Viewmodel component.
